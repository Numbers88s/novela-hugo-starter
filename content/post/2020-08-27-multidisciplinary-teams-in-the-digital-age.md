The Web is constantly changing.

Products and services are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated.  New technologies are becoming a big part of our daily lives.  The influx of new tech is hard to keep up with.  Because of this some of us just stick with the tools we know and don’t bother with checking in if there are new solutions.  Our old ways of solving problems may have become obsolete due to the increasing complexity of our needs and the problems we face on the web now.  Because of this I’d like to explore with you a more holistic approach to problem solving.

So I’m here to use a term, which is not new, but it is crucial to problem solving in this day and age, Interdisciplinary thinking.

## What is interdisciplinary thinking?

Interdisciplinary is the collaboration between different disciplines or areas of study to achieve innovative solutions during the creation process.  Although the creation process is not linear, we will assume here that it has four different stages.

These stages are: research, concept, evaluation, and implementation.

* <strong>Research:</strong> The research methodology can take many different shapes but its main goal is to just increase knowledge of the subject.

* <strong>Concept:</strong> The concept stage is where we use divergent thinking. We set free our minds to come up with as many crazy ideas as possible to later turn them into innovative solutions or new ways of using old solutions.

* <strong>Evaluation:</strong> The evaluation studies the feasibility and narrows down the possibilities using convergent thinking, or the opposite of divergent thinking.  Which in our case is the type of thinking that focuses on coming up with the single, well-established answer to a problem.  It is oriented to take all the solutions from the divergent thinking phase and coming up with the single best, or correct answer to a question.

* <strong>Implementation:</strong> The implementation phase is where we take action and put into operation/code the product or service.  In this stage is where the developers usually come in, to develop the outcome.  Although still well organized, they can work more independently.

## A Deep Dive

The evaluation process has traditionally been a multidisciplinary task. Now, its during the research and concept stages where innovation is born, and therefore where the different perspectives of the different disciplines are gaining more importance.  It is here where inter-disciplinary thinking comes into action.

Now a higher view of the process of collaboration.  For example let’s imaging the different disciplines carrying our their work independently.

They find a problem and they use the tools they have to solve it.  But that is not enough.  Usually projects are not only related to just one area of study.  They can be analyzed from the perspective of different disciplines.

To illustrate, imagine the outcome as a jigsaw created by the input of the different areas related to a project.  If they’re working independently they can only see the information related to their piece of work.  So the designer is focused on vertical rhythm, feel, UI, cohesion and congruency. The developer is focused on is it Javascript, Rails, Django, simple HTML, database, will it involved state management and if so, how much? (i.e. Their particular problems).

If the pieces of work cannot be joint, it is a waste of time. On the other hand, if their results are too similar, it’s a waste of resources.

If we get them to think all together from the beginning it will be easier to think of the project as a whole and to be more precise handling the resources and information during the process.

For those reasons, it is now time to work towards that interdisciplinary collaboration and find out the way to make it effectively.  It is necessary to develop a solid platform or workflow to enable this process.

The first step is to identify the barriers that can come up during this sort of practice.

Some of those difficulties are very similar to general teamwork obstacles, whereas other are more specific to inter-disciplinary.

In first place, it is important to be aware of the fact that collaboration always happens between people therefore, good communication and understanding are vital for its success.

If communication is key then a way to have quick communication is vital.  We currently all use Slack for our quick communication. If you don’t I recommend quickly adopting it in your workflow.  This is incredibly simple but having a channel exclusive to the project where everyone in the project is crucial for transparency and continuos free flow of information.  Not a team channel, a project channel. Having a team channel is open to multiple topics not concerning everyone involved and it becomes a nuisance more than a solution to discuss projects in that channel.

Now having our project channel in place, we have the first step, open communication.  But, gathering different disciplines implies bringing together different perspectives and when people feel strong about their ideas it's easy to pass from discussion to argument.

Therefore, I'd like it to go without mentioning it, but I'll mention it, it is important that all members take an open-minded and respectful approach to the discussion.  But that doesn't always happen. If the communication is not channelled there will always be negative comments such as "that wouldn't work" or "we don't do it that way". There will be people monopolizing the conversation and trying to impose their ideas.

## Normal group dynamics

Sometimes, two professionals can argue whilst making the same point. At other times, a professional might not participate just because they don't feel in control of the subject and are afraid of everyone's reaction to their "ignorance." Like a designer that doesn’t have a solid grasp on states on the web, not wanting to let anyone that they don’t understand this because their afraid of the others’ reaction to his ‘ignorance’. Listening to others, sometimes, seems to be really difficult and it is then when parallel conversations start to take place. You know, parallel conversations when I think I know what you are talking about so I answer the question from a completely different angle that doesn’t address what you are actually talking about, and you hear my comment, which makes no sense to what you are talking about but still think i know what you are talking about, and the conversation keeps going.  Neither of us talking with each other, but at each other.  Some people just leave the discussion, mentally or even physically.

In order to assure the good progress of the dialogue it is necessary the presence of an enabler: "a person who can channel that communication".

We have what we call Producers or a Technical Lead.

Apart from this enabler, at the discussion table during the research and concept stages, all the members and their inputs are at the same level. All of them are equals.

But carrying out a project does not only rely on thinking together. It would be naive to believe that at the evaluation stage all the disciplines will have the same weight.

There are two main aspects of the team to be established the member's contribution their roles within the team. People need to know what they're meant to do, how, who with, what for? If those roles are not well distributed people tend to disperse their efforts and lose track. The group might eventually achieve the result but it will definitely entail a waste of resources.

The lack of understanding in the contribution to be played is a common cause of failure in interdisciplinary collaboration. For instance to believe that our input it will have a bigger impact on the outcome that it will actually have can damage the progress of the project and usually leads to frustration and unnecessary competitiveness.

All the members of the team are individuals with their own background, goals, motivations and agenda and it is important to identify what everyone expects to achieve with their participation in the project, as well as to assure that those reasons fit into the global aims of the job.

In a big project, it might happen that one discipline is subordinated to the main domain being used mostly as a tool, and without much voice in the over‐all project. If this is not settled down from the beginning it is probable to end up losing that collaboration.

Another obstacle for the good dynamics of the team is the discrepancy between self-perception and external perception.

## Self-perception

Although the people around us see the same things we see, we don’t always have the same perception about the situation.  This difference in perceptions can bring confusion and serious misunderstanding.

## External perception

Although we all perceive situations differently, surprisingly usually agree on the perceptions that we have for each other. That leads to think that the team perception is right, whether that opinion matches with the self‐perception or not.

## How does this discrepancy happen?

Well one thing can be:

1. Our self-perception is wrong, and the way we think we are behaving is different from the way we are actually behaving.
2. It could also be that our view of ourselves is based on a previous experience which wasn’t shared with the rest of the members and therefore they cannot use that information to form their judgement.
3. Or, it is also possible that our reasoning is not coming across and people cannot work out the motivation of our actions.

Wow, jesus, that is heavy.  The world is horrible and everything is going to end.

I’m not trying to be such a worry wart, I am just stressing the fact that a mechanism to continually provide feedback is incredibly important.

Feedback mechanisms like midweek reviews, at a high level to see overall strength of the project.  Daily scrums or standup with the people in the project, not the overall team.  And a platform where progress can be seen and tracked. Like a staging environment where you can at all times now how things are going along is key.  Also, using this step in conjunction with mid week reviews is crucial to align everyone’s perception and understanding of the project.

And because of this discrepancy of perceptions other tools that help align the understanding of the project is investing in understanding more the other part to know where they are coming from.

Understanding that interdisciplinarity is a team activity and as we have seen the communication and understanding are essential as well as a good coordination of the roles and contributions of the different areas.

Tools that have help with bridging this perception gap, once the project is in motion.

As a developer, is trying to get into the mind and understand the designer as much as possible.  A team member that understands these group dynamics and understands the intricacies of interdisciplinary thinking will be an incredible asset to the team and ensures the project and the communication within it are successful.

In order to this, trying to understand the domain of the other person in more depth is important.  For example, after you’ve done the research and concepts stages.  You thought thru the problems together (research), agree on the solution (evaluation) and now its turn to implement it.  There still needs continuous clarification of the details of the implementation.  To make sure that from the beginning till the very end its a continuous group effort.

So we are in the implementation stage, where the designer with the information we collectively accrued produces the designs and its now the developers turn to implement.

At this stage, tools like knowing about vertical rhythm, typography ratio, and the designers personal stance on containers.  Is crucial to keep building on the collaboration of the project.

These are questions that I ask designer when I start a project. The goal is to understand them as much as possible, and to bridge the gap as close as i can between design and code.

<strong><u>This is the mindset.</u></strong>

The tools that allow me to implement this information are:

- xScope:
    - A powerful set of tools that are ideal for measuring, inspecting & testing on-screen graphics and layouts.
        - Mirror Effortlessly see your designs and applications on iOS and Apple Watch while you work on them from your Mac.
        - Dimensions
        - etc. —> http://xscopeapp.com/guide#dimensions
- Avocode:
    - There are a number of collaboration tools that help your teammates, share designs, improve them together, easily generates style guides and export resources in a heartbeat.
- Sympli.io
    - Collaboration platform for designers and developers that works with Xcode, Android Studio, Sketch and Photoshop.
- Slack + Github integration to notify the team as commits are added.
- Also appetize for iOS apps.  Integration for testing.
- Staging v. Local
    - Beanstalk
    - Capistrano
- Envision or Marvel App at the evaluation stage, helps the designer convey how they see this working and the developer can understand where the designer comes from and if it can be achieved in a timely manner.
- Mid Week reviews.
