# Solving Search Maze

In this article we will look to solve one of the classic graph problems, searching in a maze.

## Problem statement

```javascript
/*
 * Given a 2D array of O and X entries representing a maze with
 * designated entrance and exit points, find a path from the
 * entrance to the exit, if one exists. ðŸ˜³
 */
```

We will represent the O entries with 0's and X entries with 1's. The O entries represent open areas and the X entries represent walls. The entrance and the exit points are represented by an array, the 0th index represents the column and the 1th index represent the row.

```javascript
maze = [
  [0,0,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,1,0],
  [1,1,0,1,1],
  [0,0.0.0.0]
];
```

## Understanding the problem

We can use a DFS approach to recursively traverse the maze.

We first think of our **base case**, or how we will know when to stop recursing, is either

1. **We have reached our exit and we'd set our hasPath variable to true**
2. **We have visited every O entry and did not find the exit so we return**.
3. **We are out of bounds** so we'd return out of the recurion.
4. **We are in a visited index so we'd return**

Our time complexity for this would be **O(v+e)**.

In order to keep track of the cells we have **visited**, we will replace the O with 1.

Our **recursive action** will be to move to all the positions we are able. We will capture this movement in an array. We are able to move:

* **up**: `col, row + 1`
* **down**: `col, row - 1`
* **right**: `col + 1, row `
* **left**: `col - 1, row`

We are not able to move diagonally.

## Pseudocode

```javascript
/*
	pcode:
	- create a hasPath variable
	- create a startCol variable
	- create a startRow variable
	- create recursive function
		- base case
			- if we found destination set hasPath as true
			- if out of bounds return
			- if we have visited return
		- mark current col & row in maze as visited (set to 1)
		- recusive action
			- call recursion on all four directions
				- col, row + 1
				- col, row - 1
				- col + 1, row
				- col - 1, row
	- set startCol and startRow in the maze as visited (set to 1)
	- instantiate recursive function for all four directions
	- return hasPath
*/
```
## Code

```javascript
function solveMaze(maze, start, destination) {
  let hasPath = false;
  let startCol = start[0];
  let startRow = start[1];

  function dfs(col, row) {
    // base cases
    // we found it
    if (col == destination[0] && row == destination[1]) {
      hasPath = true;
      return;
    }

    // its out of bounds
    if (col < 0 || col > maze.length || row < 0 || row > maze[col].length) {
      return;
    }

    // we have visited already
    if (maze[col][row] !== 0) {
      return;
    }

    // mark as visited
    maze[col][row] = 1;

    // recursive action
    // top
    dfs(col, row + 1);

    // right
    dfs(col + 1, row);

    // bottom
    dfs(col, row - 1);

    // left
    dfs(col - 1, row);
  }

  // mark as visited
  maze[startCol][startRow] = 1;

  // traverse all four directions
  dfs(startCol, startRow + 1);
  dfs(startCol, startRow - 1);
  dfs(startCol + 1, startRow);
  dfs(startCol - 1, startRow);

  return hasPath;
}

let maze = [
	[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
	[0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
	[1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
];

solveMaze(maze, [0, 4], [3, 2])
```

Well that was fun. Let's see what other graph problem we can solve.
